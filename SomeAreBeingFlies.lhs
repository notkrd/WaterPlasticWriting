"What do you mean by \emph{rashes of ash}? Is industry
systematic work, assiduous activity, or ownership
of factories? Is \emph{ripple} agitate lightly? Are
we \emph{tossed} in tune when we write poems? And
what or who \emph{emboss with gloss insignias of air}?"

-Charles Bernstein, from "A Test of Poetry"
